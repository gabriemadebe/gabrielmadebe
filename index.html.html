        <h3>Rector's Remarks</h3>
        <p>I appreciate this opportunity to offer my remarks as the Rector of EASTC at this 6th EASTC convocation. I appreciate the presence of our guest of honor, The Director General of the ICT Commission of Tanzania. I appreciate the presence of all our invited guests. I am grateful for the generous contribution of benefactors who have supported us with various equipment and gift awards to students in this academic year convocation.</p>
        <p>The theme and topic allow this gathering to catch up, reflect, and contribute openly to issues that are relevant in the statistics and data science sector, professional life, research, and teaching.</p>
        <p>As you are aware, convocations within academic institutions are a well-established tradition. It is an academic ceremony that gathers academicians, students, alumni, public and private sector stakeholders, and benefactors. It is a time for the university community to catch up with alumni, welcome new students, and begin new and continue established relations with stakeholders and benefactors of the university. It is a time to exchange views on topical issues within the sector we work in, teach, research, and innovate. For this matter, I invite all stakeholders and, in particular, the ICT Commission of Tanzania to pursue collaborative information.</p>
        <p>Guest of Honor, most of the awards are funded by EASTC. I offer my sincere thanks to all those who sponsored the various awards of their choices. We are glad that you have joined us in celebrating excellence in our institution. I wish to encourage the members of the convocation and academic staff to sponsor various prizes for any category of their choice. I specifically challenge both public and private sectors to support our efforts at improving academic quality since the ultimate beneficiary is the industry. Those interested, please don’t hesitate to contact my office for further clarifications.</p>
        <p>Having said that, “by the powers vested in me, as the EASTC Rector, I now constitute and call upon this gathering to be an official academic forum and therefore declare this the 6th Convocation of the Eastern Africa Statistical Training Centre on this 13rd December 2023.”</p>
        <p>I welcome you to award the prizes to those that I will call out and address this 6th Convocation.</p>
